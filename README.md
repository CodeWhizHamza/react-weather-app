# React Weather App

This is a react app create by **Hamza**.

### How it works

1. It first of all fetchs your location data from [Ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io)
2. It feeds that data to the URL of [openweathermap API](http://api.openweathermap.org)
3. It's fetches that data to the end user in _a beautiful UI_
